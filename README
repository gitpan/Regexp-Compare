Regexp-Compare
==============

This module implements a function comparing regular expressions: it
returns true if all strings matched by the first regexp are also
matched by the second. It's meant to be used for optimization of
blacklists implemented by regular expressions (like, for example,
http://www.communitywiki.org/cw/BannedContent ).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This is an XS module, whose compilation requires a C compiler. Because
it uses internal Perl structures, it's sensitive to platform
differences and may be broken by new Perl versions - running its
testsuite for every new installation is highly recommended.
